# Currency Converter

## What is this
This is my collage graduation project.
The application provides the user with a list of exchange rates for the selected date against the ruble.
The app receives data from the website of [the Central Bank of the Russian Federation](https://www.cbr.ru) in XML format and shows it to the user in a more friendly way.
Also, it allows you to calculate any currency relative to another.

The first version of the app was not written for the graduation project in the best way. 
The app is written with a storyboard and not the best design. During development, I didn't use Git.
